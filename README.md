# PyCTRAMER
The PyCTRAMER package extends the original CTRAMER package for charge transfer (CT) rate constant calculation of condensed-phase systems. PyCTRAMER supports both intermolecular and intramolecular CT rate constant calculations. It offers automated workflow from a given molecular geometry to the charge transfer rate constants on the levels of Marcus theory level and a hierarchy of approximations based on equilibrium Fermi's golden rule (FGR).
